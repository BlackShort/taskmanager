# Task Manager – Performance Monitoring Utility

## 📋 Project Overview

In modern computing, efficient resource management is essential for smooth system operation. While Windows includes a built-in Task Manager, it often lacks customization, intuitive design, and deep monitoring capabilities. This project proposes the development of a **Task Manager** with advanced features, better usability, and real-time monitoring.

## 🔍 Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of CPU usage, memory usage, and running processes.
- **Customizable UI** for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Advanced process management** tools (start, stop, prioritize).
- **Detailed insights** including CPU history, memory usage trends, and process lifecycle.
- **Data visualization** using graphs and charts for easier interpretation.
- Built using:
  - `.NET Framework` for platform compatibility.
  - `C#` for system-level task handling.
  - `XAML` for user interface design.
  - `WPF` (Windows Presentation Foundation) for dynamic UI components.
  - `Visual Studio` as the development environment.

## 🛠 System Requirements

### Software Requirements:
- Windows OS
- .NET Framework
- Visual Studio IDE (with WPF support)

### Hardware Requirements:
- Minimum 2 GHz Processor
- 4 GB RAM
- 100 MB of Disk Space

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide an intuitive and flexible task manager GUI.
- Improve upon the visualization and interpretation of system metrics.
- Help both technical and non-technical users effectively monitor system performance.

## 🚧 Known Limitations of Default Windows Task Manager

1. Limited customization of the interface.
2. Lack of historical and visual insights.
3. Basic process management functionality.
4. Overly complex for non-technical users.

## ✅ Advantages of This Custom Task Manager

- Enhanced UI and UX design with WPF.
- Detailed breakdown of system activity.
- Custom views and filtering options for ease of use.
- Simplified interface for novice users while retaining advanced options.
